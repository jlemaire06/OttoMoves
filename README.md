# OttoMoves
Answers to the question : "How Otto robot moves ?" and a simplified Arduino C++ library to control and command its movements.

I tried to explain simply the essential role of the oscillations in the Otto movements and to define a little Arduino library
implementing the main movements and enabling Bluetooth commands of the robot. It uses many OOP and C++ concepts : inheritance, 
pointer on class methods, polymorphism, templates, etc.

Complements :
- How to command Otto with the voice
- About Otto distances ensor and buzzer
